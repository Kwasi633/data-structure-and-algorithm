**ALGORITHM AND DATA STRUCTURES**

**ALGORITHM**

Algorithm is a set of instructions for completing a task. In `CS` it means a set of steps a program takes to finish a task.

Recursive function is a function that calls itself.

**Recursive Depth:** The number of times a function calls itself.

**Algorithmic Thinking:** An approach to problem solving that involves breaking a problem down into a clearly defined input and output along with a distined set of steps for going from input to output.

**ALGORITHM STEPS**
- The steps in the algorithm need to be in a specific order.
- The steps need to be distinct.
- The steps should produce a result.
- The algorithm should complete in a finite amount of time.

**RUNTIMES**
- Constant
- Linear
- Quadratic
- Logarithmic

**DATA STRUCTURE**
It refers to a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be used efficiently.


Array

**Opeartions on dataStructures** 
- Acscess and read values
- Search for an arbitrary values
- Insert values at any point inti the in structure.
- Delete values in the strucuture
